# 🦅 Eagle Eye: Community-First Strategy (B2G)

> **Core Philosophy:** "The City is a Living Organism. The Community is its Nervous System."
> **Pivot:** Shift from "Web Scraping" (Passive) to "Crowdsourcing" (Active).

---

## 1. The "B2G" Business Model (Business to Government)
We do not sell to the tourist. We sell to the **City Hall (Prefeitura)** as a "Smart Tourism Intelligence Suite".

**The Value Proposition:**
*   **For City Hall:** Real-time data on tourism assets, automated SEO for local businesses, and a direct channel to engage citizens.
*   **For Citizens:** A gamified way to "level up" their city, earn rewards, and receive AI-driven guidance.
*   **For Tourists:** Truthful, verified information by locals, not just generic TripAdvisor algorithms.

## 2. The "Consensus Engine" (Truth v1.0)
How do we trust the data without a manual review army? **Consensus via Triangulation.**

**The Confidence Score Formula (0-100%):**
*   **Base (User Input):** +10% (Subjective Opinion)
*   **AI Cross-Check (Web/Exa):** +20% (If web signals match)
*   **Corroboration (Other Users):** +15% per unique user verification.
*   **Owner Claim:** +40% (Business owner verifies via Gov.br/CNPJ).
*   **"Trusted Guide" Badge:** Users with Level 5+ give +30% weight.

**Thresholds:**
*   **< 30%:** "Unverified Rumor" (Hidden or marked 'Low Confidence')
*   **30-70%:** "Community Signal" (Visible but flagged)
*   **> 70%:** "Verified Truth" (Official Star)

## 3. The User Journey: "Zero Friction" Onboarding
The user shouldn't need to "learn" the app. They just talk.

**Step 1: The "Hitchhiker" Guide (AI Chatbot)**
*   *User opens app.*
*   *AI:* "Olá! Sou o Eagle Eye. Vi que você está perto da Lagoa Grande. O quiosque de coco está aberto hoje?"
*   *User:* "Sim, tá aberto e tem música ao vivo."
*   *AI:* "Show! Registrei 'Música ao Vivo'. Você acabou de ganhar 10 Pontos. Quer mandar uma foto para comprovar e ganhar +50?"

**Step 2: The Loop (Missions)**
*   AI detects data gaps (e.g., "Missing Hours for Hotel X").
*   AI generates a "Mission": "Verify Hotel X Hours (Reward: Free Coffee Voucher)".
*   User accepts -> Goes to location -> Updates -> Earns Reward.

## 5. Monetization & Sustainability
