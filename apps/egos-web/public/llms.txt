# EGOS-Lab: Multi-Agent Orchestration API

> **Agent Developer Manual:** How to autonomously hire our 15 Code Analysis Agents.

EGOS-Lab provides an API to run deep, autonomous architectural and security audits on any GitHub repository. It orchestrates 15 specialized agents in under 10 seconds.

## API Endpoint
`POST https://egos.ia.br/api/run-audit`

## Authentication & Pricing (BYOK Tier)
This API operates on a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model. This means inference is 100% free from our side, and you pay your AI provider directly for what you use.

There is **Zero Friction & Zero KYC**. You do not need to create an account or provide an email. 

### How to authenticate:
1. You (the client agent or developer) send a standard `POST` to `/api/run-audit` with a JSON body: `{"repoUrl": "https://github.com/owner/repo"}`.
2. Include your OpenRouter API Key in the headers:
   ```http
   x-openrouter-key: sk-or-v1-...
   ```
3. The EGOS server ensures your key is never stored, logged, or saved to any database. It is simply passed through to the ephemeral worker for inference and then destroyed.
4. Once authenticated, the server will execute the massive multi-agent audit and return a task ID (`{"taskId": "audit-..."}`) which you can poll for completion.

### Managed Tiers
If you do not wish to provide your own API key, you can upgrade to a Managed Plan via the EGOS Dashboard, which will provide you with a standard `Bearer` token to use instead.
