# 💼 Egos Business Engineering (IA-First)

> **Philosophy:** Code is Abundant. Trust is Scarce. Egos builds Trust.
> **Model:** Open Core (Egos Lab) + Commercial SaaS (Apps) + High-Ticket Services (Intelink).

## 1. 🏭 The Egos Engine (Open Core)
**What:** The entire `egos-lab` infrastructure (Standards, Rules, Base Templates).
**Price:** Free / Open Source.
**Goal:** Build a community of developers who use *our* standards.
**Value:**
- 🤝 Recruitment: Identify top talent effectively.
- 🚀 Speed: Rapid prototyping for partners.
- 🌟 Brand: Establish authority in "Agentic Engineering".

## 2. 🦅 The SaaS Fleet (Revenue)
Apps built *on top* of the engine, sold to end-users.

|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Eagle Eye** | Lawyers, Gov, NGOs | Subscription ($99/mo) | 🟢 LIVE (MVP) |
| **Cloud Legal** | Law Firms | Per-Analysis Fee | 🟡 Blueprint |
| **Revisor** | News Agencies | Enterprise License | 🟡 Blueprint |

**Strategy:**
1.  **Build Eagle Eye:** Reach $5k MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue).
2.  **Reinvest:** Fund development of Intelink.
3.  **Spin-off:** Launch next SaaS (Cloud Legal).

## 3. 🧠 Intelink Services (High Ticket)
**What:** Custom implementation of "The Brain" for enterprises.
**Price:** $10k+ Setup + Retainer.
**Client:** Companies needing their own "Central Intelligence".
**Strategy:** "You prefer to build it yourself? Here's our Open Source engine. You want US to build it? Here's the contract."

## 4. 🤝 Partnership Program (The Multiplier)
**"Egos Certified Partner"**
- Devs use our stack & brand.
- They sell to their local clients (e.g., "MercadoMind" in Patos/MG).
- **Split:** 80% Partner / 20% Egos Lab (Royalty).
- **Benefit:** We provide the "Engine" updates; they handle sales/support.
