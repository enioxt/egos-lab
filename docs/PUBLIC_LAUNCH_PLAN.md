# EGOS Lab — Public Launch Plan v1.0
> **Goal:** Transition from "Private Lab" to "Public Agentic Hub"
> **Strategy:** "Show, Don't Tell" — Give visitors immediate value via agents.

---

## 1. The Core Value Proposition

**Why EGOS?**
Most developer tools are "install and config". EGOS is "click and receive".
We offer **Agentic Audits as a Service** (free, open source).

**The Hook:**
"Is your repo safe? Clean? Organized? Let our 10 agents check it in 4 seconds."

## 2. User Journey (The "Why Stay" Loop)

### Step 1: Arrival (The Vibe)
- **Visuals:** Hero particles, activity stream, Espiral de Escuta.
- **Feeling:** "Something alive is happening here."
- **Problem:** "It looks cool, but what does it do for ME?"

### Step 2: The Offer (The Hook)
- **New Section:** "Audit Your Codebase" (Prominent CTA).
- **Input:** Paste a GitHub Repository URL.
- **Action:** "Run Agents".

### Step 3: The Value (The Report)
- **Output:** A beautiful, interactive report generated by our Orchestrator.
  - 🛡️ **Security:** Leaked secrets, risky patterns.
  - 🏗️ **Architecture:** SSOT violations, dependency chaos.
  - 🧹 **Hygiene:** Dead code, duplicate types.
- **Result:** User gets actionable insights *immediately*.

### Step 4: Retention (The Contribution)
- **CTA:** "Fix these issues automatically with EGOS Agents."
- **Path:** "Fork EGOS Lab", "Install CLI", "Join the Spiral".
- **Reward:** Their commits appear in the **Espiral de Escuta**, building reputation.

## 3. Roadmap to Launch

### Phase 1: The "Open Door" (Current)
- [x] **Mission Control:** Live at `egos.ia.br`.
- [x] **Transparency:** Source code open, commits visible in Espiral.
- [x] **Identity:** Login via GitHub enabled.
- [ ] **Content:** Populate "Ideas Catalog" with real "Help Wanted" issues.

### Phase 2: The "Service" (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] **Agent API:** Expose `orchestrator.ts` via an API endpoint (securely).
- [ ] **Audit UI:** Create the "Paste Repo URL" input on the dashboard.
- [ ] **Report View:** Render JSONL logs as a nice UI component.

### Phase 3: The "Community" (Month 1)
- [ ] **Reputation System:** Gamify contributions (fixes = points).
- [ ] **Agent Marketplace:** Allow users to submit their own audit agents.

## 4. Content Strategy (Exposure)

**LinkedIn / Twitter / Dev.to:**
- **Post 1:** "I built a 3D commit visualizer that listens to code." (Visual hook)
- **Post 2:** "Why I fired my linter and hired 10 agents." (Controversial/Technical)
- **Post 3:** "Paste your repo, get an audit in 4s." (Utility hook)

**GitHub:**
- **README:** Optimize for "One-Command Run" (`bun agent:all`).
- **Issues:** Label issues clearly with "Good First Issue" for the spiral.

## 5. Immediate Action Items

1. **Expose the Orchestrator:** We need a way to run agents on *external* public repos via the web UI.
2. **Polish the Report:** The Markdown report is great, but a React component reading the JSON output is better.
3. **Docs:** "How to Audit Your Repo" tutorial.
