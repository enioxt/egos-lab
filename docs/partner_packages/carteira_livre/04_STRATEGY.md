## 1. Launch Phase: "Operation Pilot"
**Target:** 1 City (Curitiba-PR or Sorocaba-SP).
**Duration:** 3 Months.
**Goal:** Prove liquidity (Match Rate > 80%).

### Tactics
- **Supply Side (Instructors):**
    - **"Freedom Bonus":** R$ 500 bonus for first 50 instructors who leave CFCs.
    - **Direct Sales:** Visit CFC parking lots and handout flyers discreetly ("Ganhe 3x mais").
    - **Partnership:** Local car rental agencies (Discounted dual-pedal kit installation).
- **Demand Side (Students):**
    - **SEO:** "Autoescola barata Curitiba", "Aula extra direção".
    - **TikTok/Shorts:** "Como paguei R$ 1000 a menos na CNH" (Viral content).
    - **Referral:** "Give R$ 20, Get R$ 20".

## 2. Expansion Phase: "State Domination"
**Target:** Entire State (Paraná or São Paulo).
**Trigger:** Reaching 500 active instructors in Pilot.

### Tactics
- **Ambassador Program:** Top instructors recruit others for 5% commission override (Multi-level, capped at 1 tier).
- **University Partnerships:** Student Union discounts.
- **Detran Lobbying:** Show data that "Independent Students" have higher pass rates (Data-driven lobbying).

## 3. Monetization Strategy
- **Take Rate:** 15% of lesson fee (Market standard is 20-25%).
- **SaaS for Instructors:** Premium Plan (R$ 49/mo) -> Auto-schedule, Tax prep, Priority support.
- **Fintech:** "Carteira Pay" -> Advance earnings for instructors (Factoring).

## 4. Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **CFC Strike/Protest** | High | Medium | PR Campaign positioning CFCs as "Cartel". |
