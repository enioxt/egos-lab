## Prompt:
sobre os melhroes do mercado pra mim, me entregue tudo que encontrar:

Activate the unified system for wide-ranging research on the best global CRM, cash flow, inventory, and supplier management systems, as well as deep insights for a frozen cookie and cheese bread company, prioritizing open source and modular solutions.

\- Thoroughly activate system "000\_unified\_system\_activation" as your first step.

\- Research using the complete internal framework.

\- Identify and analyze the best systems worldwide for:

\- Customer Relationship Management (CRM)

\- Cash flow management

\- Inventory control

\- Supplier management

\- Insight generation for a business focused on frozen cookies and cheese breads

\- Give clear preference to open-source and modular solutions, as components/ideas may be recombined or adapted as needed.

\- Seek solutions that enable adaptation, customization, and potential integration of large language models (LLM).

\- For each category, provide a shortlist of recommended systems and summarize their most relevant modules, integration capabilities, and unique features.

Proceed step by step: complete each objective methodically, and do not deliver the final answer until all objectives are satisfied. Think through each step, ensuring each area is fully explored and all options weighed before providing conclusions.

\*\*REASONING & OUTPUT ORDER INSTRUCTIONS\*\*

\- Document your research process (reasoning) before presenting conclusions or recommendations for each category.

\- Never begin examples or outputs with conclusions; always show reasoning and research first, then produce recommendations, lists, or summaries.

\*\*OUTPUT FORMAT\*\*

\- Structure the output as a JSON object with the following fields for each system type:

\- "category": \[CRM, cash\_flow, inventory, suppliers, insights\]

\- "reasoning": Step-by-step outline of the research process and criteria used to evaluate solutions in that category.

\- "recommendations": List of the best 2-5 systems, with for each:

\- "name"

\- "type" (e.g. open source, modular, SaaS)

\- "modules/features"

\- "integration\_capability"

\- "unique\_advantages"

\- "potential\_LLM\_integration\_points"

\- "suggested\_adaptation\_strategy": How the best ideas/modules in this category could be adapted, customized, or combined for the target company.

If details require examples, use the following format:

\*\*EXAMPLES START\*\*

\_Input Example:\_

category: crm

reasoning: Investigated open-source options focusing on modularity and integration flexibility. Top criteria included active developer community and established plug-in/extension ecosystem.

recommendations:

\- name: "Odoo CRM"

type: "Open Source Modular"

modules/features: "Lead Management, Sales Pipeline, Custom Dashboards"

integration\_capability: "REST API, extensive plug-ins"

unique\_advantages: "Highly modular, large active community, widely used in food retail sector"

potential\_LLM\_integration\_points: "Automated lead scoring, custom communication"

\- name: "SuiteCRM"

... (and so on; real output examples should be more detailed and feature at least 2-3 recommendations per category)

suggested\_adaptation\_strategy: "Start with Odoo's modular system, adapting the lead/sales modules, integrate inventory/cash flow features, and leverage LLMs for automated customer insights."

\*\*EXAMPLES END\*\*

(Actual output should be a detailed, full JSON as above, covering all five categories and adaptation notes.)

\*\*REMINDER:\*\*

Fully activate the system, thoroughly research using the framework, and provide your reasoning before recommendations for each system category. Output should be a detailed JSON with reasoning first, then recommendations, per the template. Always give preference to open source & modular solutions.
