Como passar essa fase no Jurassic world de PS4?

## Response:

> > 
> > **Narrowing the Search**
> > 
> > I've decided to refine the search. I'm prioritizing finding walkthroughs or guides now. My strategy is to zero in on solutions for puzzles involving the diamond-shaped lock. My next step involves determining which character abilities are necessary to interact with this particular mechanism. I am on the verge of knowing how to resolve this.
> > 
> > **Investigating Puzzle Solution**
> > 
> > I'm currently trying to solve the blue door puzzle in LEGO Jurassic World. It seems I need to figure out the correct sequence for the lights above the door, based on the diamond's position. This is the latest development in the thought process - my primary focus is understanding the light pattern! I'll break down the image details next.
> > 
> > **Identifying Interaction Mechanics**
> > 
> > I've been examining the different interactive mechanics in the game, focusing on character abilities. I've compiled a list of characters associated with access panels, electric targets, and hacking terminals. It looks like the blue diamond and light mechanism is probably a new type of interaction, but similar to the panels. I'm trying to determine if it is a specific interaction or a broader type of interaction. I've noted down the characters associated with each mechanic.
> > 
> > **Analyzing Door Mechanism**
> > 
> > The blue diamond mechanism strongly resembles a "Jurassic World Access Panel" or "Scanner" panel. Blue and white cues often mean a scanner or tech character. It has a blue diamond, a white center, and four lights around it. It's not a "Hacker" terminal, which are mini-games. It looks like it could be a scanner door where a tech character with a tablet/scanner needs to scan the door. Let me search "blue diamond door lego jurassic world".
> > 
> > **Defining Interaction Type**
> > 
> > Now I'm focusing on the specific type of mechanism. I've ruled out "Lightning/Electric" targets and "Scanner" targets. My current working hypothesis is that it's a "Jurassic World Access Panel" - perhaps a larger, more elaborate version. I'm investigating characters with the "Access" ability, like **Lowery Cruthers**, **Vivian**, and **Claire Dearing**, particularly for JW-specific panels. Also, the prompt is in Portuguese: "Como passar essa fase..." and it would be better to answer in Portuguese. I'm trying to determine whether Lowery or Claire is needed, or if the "Lock" is different.
> > 
> > **Confirming Location & Icon**
> > 
> > I've been re-examining the environment and iconography. I believe this blue diamond door is a specific door within the Indominus Rex paddock or a similar secure facility. The icon, a blue diamond with a white square, is a clue. I'm focusing on the characters who might be involved in this location and ability, such as **Supervisor Nick** and **Henry Wu**. I'm currently verifying the visual of the in-game "Jurassic World Access Panel" to confirm if it applies here.
> > 
> > **Clarifying Icon Function**
> > 
> > I'm now zeroing in on the icon's precise meaning. It's definitely a UI element, not part of the environment. The floating icon strongly suggests a tech interaction or scanner is needed. Based on this, I'm confident that it's either a _Scanner_ panel or a _Monitor_ interaction. I'll search for icons with similar shapes to refine my hypothesis and confirm if it is scanner or tech related. I'm focusing on the characters with scanner or tech abilities.
> > 
> > **Considering Visual Clues**
> > 
> > I'm now focusing on the visual cues, specifically the blue diamond with a white square and surrounding light "canisters." It seems to represent the "Scanner" or "Access Panel" target. Result 1.2's mention of "green vents" and "blue diamond panels" further solidified this, suggesting activation might be linked to the blue diamond panels. I am considering ways to relate this to the current theory.
> > 
> > **Refining Character Roles**
> > 
> > I'm now zeroing in on character roles. Result 1.2 clearly links Barry's shock rifle to the blue diamond panels. While other results associate "blue targets" (typically circular) with Barry, the visual clue is paramount. The "canisters" surrounding the blue diamond mechanism seem like potential indicators for a Scanner point. The access panels in Jurassic World seem to require a scanner. Result 3.3 strongly suggests a correlation between the blue diamond, the shock rifle and access panel usage, but the scanner is also involved.
> > 
> > **Analyzing Target Design**
> > 
> > I've been examining the target design. The "blue diamond with white center" icon appears to be a direct match for the shock rifle target, a confirmation that Barry is the character to use it. I'm now weighing the possibility that it might be a new access panel type. The blue diamond shape has the characteristics of a target though, which is crucial. Result 3.3 adds additional weight to the idea of this being a shock rifle target, and that is a key component of my analysis. The steam thread helped resolve any remaining doubts.
> > 
> > **Deciphering Interaction Method**
> > 
> > I'm now concentrating on the interaction method. The image of the closed gate with a floating icon clearly points to an interaction point. I think I need to shoot the high-up target, given the position. While I had considered Claire's scanner, it seems that such tools typically operate on nearby objects. My focus has shifted back to the shock rifle. Could the blue diamond be the symbol for an electric switch, perhaps requiring Barry (or an ACU trooper) to activate it? The lights around the target suggest some type of tech interface. The lightning bolt motif isn't present, so this may not be a standard electric target. My intuition points towards this being a shock rifle target.
> > 
> > **Exploring Interaction Mechanics**
> > 
> > I'm now refining the interaction method. I've concluded the blue diamond panel is a shock rifle target, linked to Barry (or ACU Trooper). The Steam discussion cemented this. While access panels are typically hand-operated, this high-up location and the electric motif suggest shooting it with the shock rifle. While I initially considered a scanner door, the blue diamond isn't the standard scanner icon. However, this could represent either a shock rifle target or perhaps a scanner that opens an electric switch. I'll propose both possible explanations.
> > 
> > **Identifying the Culprit**
> > 
> > I've zeroed in on the character issue. The player is likely using Owen, who carries a lethal rifle. The visual clue, the blue diamond, strongly suggests the _electric_ rifle, held by Barry or an ACU Trooper, is required. I've confirmed that the blue diamond signifies an electric switch. This likely caused the user's predicament, with Owen and his lethal gun being the wrong tool.
> > 
> > **Clarifying Action Steps**
> > 
> > My thoughts have now crystallized around the required action. It's clear that the player needs to utilize Barry, or an ACU Trooper, equipped with a taser rifle. The user will need to aim and shoot the blue target, presumably to charge or activate it. Owen's firearm is ineffective. The surrounding "capsules" of the icon reinforce the idea of an electrical charge. Furthermore, the icon itself is a definitive "Electric Target" indicator, strongly supporting the choice of Barry. My previous doubts about other target types are also clarified: this is distinctly the "Electric Target". Portuguese translation: Character: Barry.
> > 
> > **Considering Level Context**
> > 
> > I'm now integrating the level context into my thought process. Analyzing the door style, I believe this is "Secure Pen" level, and since it is an electrical target, Barry (or an ACU Trooper) and his shock rifle are required. I'm focusing on confirming Barry's availability. If it's story mode, Barry is likely in the party.
> > 
> > **Concluding Taser Target**
> > 
> > I'm solidifying my approach now. The blue diamond with a white square is the key: it's a clear indication of a shock rifle target, and therefore, **Barry** (or an ACU Trooper) is the character needed. I'm focusing on providing instructions to aim, and shoot the target. I'll make sure to mention that regular weapons won't work. The plan to check if the user is in free play, or if there is an ACU trooper nearby, is also key.

Com base na imagem e na mecânica do jogo LEGO Jurassic World, aqui está o que você precisa fazer para passar dessa parte:

O ícone de **diamante azul** com luzes ao redor indica um **Alvo Elétrico** (Electric Switch).

### Solução:

1.  **Troque de Personagem:** Você precisa usar um personagem que tenha o **Rifle de Choque** (Taser) ou Bastão de Choque.
    *   O personagem principal para isso é o **Barry**.
    *   Outros personagens genéricos como o **ACU Trooper** (Soldado da ACU) ou alguns guardas também possuem essa arma.
2.  **Ação:** Mire no mecanismo azul acima da porta (segure o botão de ataque para mirar) e atire. A eletricidade vai carregar as "células" ao redor do losango e a porta se abrirá.

**Por que você pode estar travado:** O personagem que você está usando na foto parece ser o Owen Grady. A arma padrão do Owen é um rifle comum, que **não** ativa esses painéis azuis. Você obrigatoriamente precisa da arma de choque (que dispara um raio elétrico azul).

_Dica:_ Se você estiver no Modo Livre (Free Play), basta segurar o botão de troca de personagem e selecionar o Barry. Se estiver no Modo História, procure pelo Barry ou outro guarda na sua equipe atual.

## Prompt:
Não tem a opção de selecionar outro personagem, estou no modo história

My aim is to determine if any characters present possess electric abilities or if there's an associated puzzle that grants temporary access to an electric tool. Once I identify the specific character or environmental interaction needed, I can provide the user with the precise solution for this story mode section.

I thought switching to Barry would do the trick, but it appears that isn't the solution, and I'm back at square one with the blue diamond target. I'm wondering if there's another character I haven't tried yet, or if there's an environmental puzzle I'm missing.
> > 
> > **Identifying the Culprit**
> > 
> > It seems I jumped to conclusions about character availability. My focus shifted to the 'Jurassic World' campaign levels, particularly the Raptor Research Area. The image suggests a paddock, which aligns with that location. I'm now zeroing in on a blue diamond panel and what kind of character is needed to interact with it. The solution likely involves a specific ability to activate that type of switch.
> > 
> > **Narrowing the Options**
> > 
> > I've been thinking about the level structure in Lego Jurassic World. Specifically, I'm trying to pin down the player's location. The blue diamond suggests a switch mechanism. I'm focusing on the "Welcome to Jurassic World" level, and the possibility of Barry being available but overlooked. My thoughts have shifted from thinking about hub areas to the core level design and the availability of secondary characters. I'm considering potential environmental interactions, such as generators, that might be needed to solve the puzzle at hand. The goal is to avoid unnecessary assumptions and keep a level head while searching the area for clues.
> > 
> > **Uncovering Potential Interactions**
> > 
> > I'm now zeroing in on the electric switch and considering Owen's abilities. The Raptor Paddock seems likely, especially if the player is in the "Raptor Transfer" portion of the story. I'm thinking about how Owen can interact with the environment, whether it's powering something up or even utilizing raptor interactions. The player is most likely trying to use Owen to open this gate. The location may be "Welcome to Jurassic World". Perhaps the player is at the hub. Is Barry available? If not, could there be a requirement to unlock Barry?
> > 
> > **Examining Level Progression**
> > 
> > It's seeming more likely the user is in "Welcome to Jurassic World," and Barry is crucial, but potentially unavailable due to a glitch or misunderstanding of character switching. Alternatively, it may be the hub, but I'm leaning toward the main level as the puzzle's location. The J-W logo on the door solidifies this. I'm focusing on "Raptor Paddock" within "Welcome to Jurassic World", as this aligns with the available characters and potential puzzle elements. I'm also considering potential level design constraints that could be preventing the user from progressing as expected.
> > 
> > **Verifying the Pathway**
> > 
> > I'm now thinking specifically about the "Welcome to Jurassic World" level, and the possibility of a "Free Play" gate in the Hub. My plan is to figure out whether the player is actually in the main level, or a Hub area. The goal is to determine if this is a story mode requirement, or something separate from the main level flow. I need to make sure I am not considering something that might not be available at this point. I'll need to figure out which character is missing if it is indeed in the main level. If it's a hub door, I'll need to make sure I can help them realize the level start marker.
> >

> > I'm now focusing on character switching in Lego Jurassic World, specifically in story mode. It seems the player is stuck at a blue door with an electric switch. Considering the location and the blue diamond target, I'm thinking the player is in the Raptor Paddock level in "Welcome to Jurassic World". The prompt to switch characters could be missing, or they may simply not know the control for it. Since only Barry has the shock rifle required, I'm exploring whether the player is encountering a glitch preventing character selection or is unaware of the mechanic. I need to make sure I identify this properly!
> > 
> > **Confirming the Key Concept**
> > 
> > I've been reviewing the level design again. My recent thinking has focused on clarifying a point that the player may not realize: In the "Welcome to Jurassic World" level, story mode, only a _tap_ of the character swap button is necessary to switch to Barry. I'll need to confirm if they're holding the button, which opens the character grid. Also, I'm verifying if that blue door is part of the story progression or a "Free Play" area. Finally, I'm ensuring the user is indeed in "Welcome to Jurassic World" and not a different level or the hub.

I'm searching online for "Lego Jurassic World Raptor Paddock electric switch" images and videos to make sure the user is facing the correct puzzle. This will help confirm if the user's perception of the problem matches the actual in-game challenge. The objective is to identify and address any visual discrepancies or misunderstandings that might be hindering progress. Hopefully, the search will provide a clear visual match.

> > I'm now thinking the user might be stuck in Story Mode as Owen, and needs to simply _tap_ the character swap button instead of holding it. Alternatively, Barry could be off-screen or the user might be in a hub area. If the door isn't part of the main level, they can ignore it and follow the blue studs. If it _is_ part of the level, it could be a bug.

I'll instruct the user to tap the character swap button, search for Barry, or, if in the hub, follow the blue studs. A level restart may be needed if Barry is glitched. My analysis of the blue diamond switch confirms the need for Barry or an ACU Trooper, solidifying the next steps to provide a targeted solution.
> > 
> > **Confirming Level Mechanics**
> > 
> > I've determined the user is in the "Welcome to Jurassic World" level, specifically near the Raptor Research Arena. They need Barry to shoot a target to open the paddock. The core issue is likely the user's difficulty switching characters. I will emphasize the difference between tapping and holding the character swap button, as this is a common issue in Lego games, especially when the AI partner is required. I'll also clarify that this is a level, not the Hub, to avoid confusion. If there is a glitch, a level restart is the last resort.
> > 
> > **Identifying the Core Problem**
> > 
> > I've determined that the specific level is "Welcome to Jurassic World," and the solution requires Barry's Shock Rifle to hit a target and open the velociraptor pen. The primary issue remains the user's inability to switch characters to Barry. I'll emphasize the necessity of _tapping_ the Triangle button to swap characters, and I'll confirm that the target icon is the "Electric Switch." If Barry is unavailable, a level restart might be necessary. I'll now deliver the response in Portuguese to the PS4 user.
> > 
> > **Detecting the Partner**
> > 
> > I'm now thinking the user might be in a situation where the partner character is not readily visible in the top corner of the HUD. A glitch or a Hub World location change are possible, so I'll suggest looking for the partner's face in the circle on the HUD, if enabled. If the game does not show the partner, I'll suggest restarting the level as a possible solution.

Essa é uma situação comum no modo história do LEGO Jurassic World e tem uma explicação simples (ou uma solução chata se for um _bug_).

### O Problema

Você está na área do **Paddock dos Raptores** (provavelmente na fase "Welcome to Jurassic World" ou no Hub). Esse alvo azul (interruptor elétrico) **só pode ser ativado pelo personagem Barry**, que tem o Rifle de Choque (arma de raio azul). O Owen (seu personagem atual) não consegue ativar isso.

### Como resolver se "não aparece a opção de trocar"

Se você está no Modo História, o Barry **deveria** estar com você. Aqui estão as causas prováveis e como corrigir:

**1\. Você está tentando trocar do jeito errado (Erro mais comum)**

*   No PS4, se você **segurar** o triângulo ( $\triangle$ ), o jogo tenta abrir a grade de personagens (que é bloqueada no modo história).
*   **Solução:** Apenas dê um **toque rápido** no triângulo ( $\triangle$ ). Isso deve alternar instantaneamente para o seu parceiro (Barry), que deve estar parado em algum lugar próximo.

**2\. Você está no "Mundo Aberto" (Hub) e não na Fase**

*   Se você está andando livremente pela ilha e encontrou esse portão, ele pode ser um quebra-cabeça opcional de "Jogo Livre" (Free Play) para pegar blocos dourados ou vermelhos.
*   **Solução:** Se não houver nenhuma missão ativa piscando ali, ignore esse portão por enquanto. Siga as **peças azuis fantasmas** (blue studs) no chão; elas guiam você para o local correto onde a história continua.

**3\. O personagem bugou/sumiu (Bug)**

*   Às vezes, o personagem parceiro fica preso atrás de uma parede ou "cai" do mapa e o jogo não deixa você trocar.
*   **Solução:** Infelizmente, você precisará reiniciar a fase ou sair para o menu principal e voltar.
    *   Aperte **Options** \> **Sair da Fase** (ou Exit Level).
    *   Reinicie a fase "Welcome to Jurassic World" (Bem-vindo ao Jurassic World). O Barry deve reaparecer ao seu lado no início da seção.

**Resumo da Ação:** Procure pelo **Barry** (homem negro com colete). Use a arma dele, segure o botão de ataque (Quadrado  $\square$ ) para mirar no losango azul até encher a carga elétrica e a porta abrirá.

Pela imagem, vocês estão no **Laboratório da InGen** (parte da história do _Jurassic Park 3_), jogando em modo cooperativo (tela dividida).

Esse menu que você abriu é o menu de **Extras**. Aqui está o que cada coisa faz:

### 1\. "Inserir Código" (A primeira linha)

É aqui que você pode digitar senhas (que você encontra na internet) para desbloquear coisas instantaneamente sem precisar jogar para conquistar.

**Quer testar agora?** Se você clicar ali e digitar este código:

*   **5MZ73E**: Libera o multiplicador de **Pontuação x2** (suas moedas valem o dobro).

### 2\. "Pontuação x8: Disponível para Compra"

Essa é a parte mais importante da sua tela! Vocês encontraram o **Bloco Vermelho** que multiplica os pontos por 8.

*   **O que ele faz:** Se você pegar uma moeda de 10, ela vale 80. Se pegar uma azul de 1.000, ela vale 8.000.
*   **Como ativar:** Você precisa ter moedas suficientes (studs) para comprá-lo. Se tiver o dinheiro, selecione essa opção, compre e depois **ative** (bolinha verde ao lado).
*   _Dica:_ Esses multiplicadores acumulam. Se você tiver o x2 e o x8 ligados ao mesmo tempo, você ganha **x16**.

### 3\. "Bloco Vermelho: Bloqueado"

Esses são "poderes" ou "cheats" que vocês **ainda não encontraram**. Para desbloqueá-los, você precisa achar os tijolos vermelhos escondidos nas fases ou no mundo aberto. Eles dão poderes como invencibilidade, detector de itens ou deixam os dinossauros com disfarces engraçados.

**Resumo do que fazer agora:** Se tiverem dinheiro (studs) suficientes, comprem o **Pontuação x8** imediatamente. Isso vai facilitar muito comprar os outros personagens e dinossauros depois!
